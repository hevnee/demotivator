# Demotivational Poster Maker

[English](README.md) | [Russian](RU_README.md)

## Overview

A Demotivational Poster Maker is an application with GUI that helps you create a funny image with a caption below it in a "poster" or "demotivational poster" format.

## About the project

This project was created using Python with dependencies such as PySide6 and Pillow

I made it to demonstrate my knowledge. The code is clean (maybe not as clean as you think, but not messy), and I wanted to show what I learned in 4 months

## Inspiration

You know about the Telegram bot "[Ржакабот](https://t.me/super_rjaka_demotivator_bot)"? right? If not, it's a bot that creates demotivational posters and inspired me to do this project
